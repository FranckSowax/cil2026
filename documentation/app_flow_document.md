# App Flow Document for CIL2026 Website

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new visitor arrives at the CIL2026 website, they land directly on the public home page without needing to create an account. Navigation links in the header allow them to explore all sections of the site, including Présentation & Contexte, Appel à Communication, Programme, Inscription & Tarifs, Comités, and Informations Pratiques. No user accounts or logins are required for browsing, downloading documents, submitting communications, or registering for the event.

A separate login area is available for organizers who manage content. Organizers access the admin login page via a secure link in the footer labeled “Espace Organisateur.” They enter their email and password to sign in, and if credentials are forgotten they click a “Mot de passe oublié” link. This sends a reset password email so they can securely regain access. Once logged in, they can sign out at any time using the “Déconnexion” button in the admin header.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After arriving on the home page, visitors see a large hero banner featuring the CIL2026 logo, the event dates “23–27 mars 2026,” and the theme “Intelligence artificielle et dynamiques des Organisations.” Below the hero, a scrolling partner logo bar highlights sponsors and academic partners. A dynamic countdown timer shows days remaining until the submission deadline. Two prominent buttons invite users to “S’inscrire” or “Soumettre une communication.” Further down the page, a streamlined news and key dates section displays upcoming deadlines and announcements in real time. The site header remains sticky so users can jump to any major section at any moment.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

### Exploring the Présentation & Contexte Page

When a visitor clicks “Présentation & Contexte” in the header, they land on a page that explains the event theme and context. A descriptive introduction covers the role of artificial intelligence in African organizational dynamics. Four thematic axes appear in clear subsections, each with a brief summary beneath subheadings. The page concludes with an optional message from Professor Jean Moussavou and a graphic of Africa’s map composed of partner country flags, reinforcing the regional focus.

### Downloading Official Documents in Appel à Communication

By selecting “Appel à Communication,” the visitor reaches a page that provides submission guidelines. Download links offer the official PDF call for papers and a Word template directly without requiring login. Each document link opens in a new tab and begins a free download, making it easy to prepare submissions.

### Submitting a Scientific Communication

When the visitor clicks “Soumettre une communication,” they see an online form that requests name, email, institution, document type (Résumé étendu, Papier court, or Papier complet), and file upload. After selecting the file and filling in personal details, they press “Envoyer.” The system validates required fields and file type. On success, a confirmation message appears on screen and a confirmation email is immediately sent, summarizing the submission details and timeline. The form data is then emailed to larsigist@yahoo.fr for organizer review.

### Registering for the Event and Payment

Clicking “S’inscrire” brings up the registration form where visitors enter their name, affiliation, contact details, and choose their participant category (Praticien, Chercheur, Doctorant, Étudiant). The form automatically calculates the fee based on category and offers an optional pre-CIL workshop add-on. Next, the visitor chooses a payment method—Mobile Money, credit card, or cash—and sees bank transfer details if they opt for a manual virement. After submission, a confirmation page displays payment instructions and a summary of their registration. A confirmation email follows with payment details and links to download their invoice.

### Viewing the Programme and Workshops

The “Programme” link leads to an interactive timeline that visualizes all key phases: submission period, registration window, pre-CIL workshops, colloquium days, and the gala evening. Each timeline segment is clickable and expands to show detailed schedules, locations, and speaker lists. Visitors can scroll horizontally or vertically depending on their device and see a concise agenda for each date.

### Exploring Committees and Contact Information

Under “Comités,” visitors find dedicated pages for the organizational committee and the scientific committee, each listing member names, affiliations, and contact points. A photo or icon accompanies every profile to enhance readability. The “Informations Pratiques” section shows a Google Maps embed of Libreville’s venue, directions, and accommodation tips, followed by a general contact form for logistical or academic inquiries. Visitors complete their name, email, and message, then click “Envoyer” to submit. They receive an on-screen acknowledgement and an email confirming receipt of their question.

### Admin Area and Content Management

Organizers log into the secure admin area via “Espace Organisateur.” Once authenticated, they land on an internal dashboard presenting editable modules for actualités, calendrier, tarifs, programme, et documents. Clicking any module opens a visual editor where they can add or modify text, upload images, set dates, and manage file attachments. All changes are previewed live before publishing. The admin footer includes links for password change, privacy policy, and a logout button. Organizers receive email notifications when submissions or registrations occur, and they can configure reminder schedules for upcoming deadlines in the settings panel.

## Settings and Account Management

In the admin area, organizers access the “Paramètres du compte” page to update their personal information, change passwords, or configure notification preferences. They toggle on or off automatic reminder emails for submission deadlines, registration cut-offs, and the colloquium start. Once settings are saved, a confirmation banner appears, and they can click the header logo to return to the admin dashboard or use the main navigation to preview public site pages.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If a visitor submits a form with missing or invalid data, a red-highlighted error message details the specific fields needing correction. The form remains populated to avoid retyping. In case of network issues or server timeouts, a fallback page apologizes for the interruption and offers a “Réessayer” button or suggests contacting support via the general contact form. For payment failures, the system displays a clear error describing the issue and prompts the user to choose an alternate payment method. Admin users who mistype their credentials see an inline error and can click “Mot de passe oublié” to reset their password.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

A new visitor to the CIL2026 site begins on the home page, learns about the event’s theme, downloads submission documents, and either immediately submits a communication or registers for attendance. They receive confirmation emails and can explore detailed schedules, committees, and practical information without ever creating an account. Organizers use a parallel admin area to keep content fresh and send automated reminders. By following this clear flow, all participants stay informed and engaged from the first click through to the event’s final gala.
